Antibody Target: ESR1; antibody targetdescription: This gene encodes an estrogen receptor, a ligand-activated transcription factor composed of several domains important for hormone binding, DNA binding, and activation of transcription. The protein localizes to the nucleus where it may form a homodimer or a heterodimer with estrogen receptor 2. Estrogen and its receptors are essential for sexual development and reproductive function, but also play a role in other tissues such as bone. Estrogen receptors are also involved in pathological processes including breast cancer, endometrial cancer, and osteoporosis. Alternative splicing results in several transcript variants, which differ in their 5-prime UTRs and use different promoters.

Alternate names for HDAC1 include RPD3L1, HD1, GON-10, and DKFZp686H12203.; antibody vendorname: Santa Cruz Biotech; antibody vendorid: sc-6298; treatment: None; treatment description: No special treatment or protocol applies; control: std; control description: Standard input signal for most experiments.; controlid: K562/Input/std; softwareversion: ScriptureVPaperR3"}, {"id": "GSM1422929", "title": "Hmel-shGFP-H4K20ME1", "description": "partially transformed melanocytic line: HMEL; clone subtype: Hmel-shGFP; cell phentype: non-tumorigenic variant; chip antibody: H4K20ME1; chip antibody vendor-cat.#: Abcam-ab9051", "characteristics": "Homo sapiens"}, {"id": "GSM2417119", "title": "preiPSC#1_H3_ChIP-Seq", "description": "strain: 129SV/Jae/C57BL6J; cell type: pre-iPSC", "characteristics": "Mus musculus"}, {"id": "GSM1706675", "title": "ES02HDAC2", "description": "no treatment", "characteristics": "cell type: human embryonic stem cells (hESCs); passages: p71; reprogramming method: None; clone: None; chip antibody: HDAC2 (Cell Signaling, 2545S)"}, {"id": "GSM2467774", "title": "Pol2_d60_1", "description": "Cells were starved overnight in medium without additives and then stimulated with EGF (e), DEX (d) or the combination (ed) for the indicated time intervals (minutes) before sequencing", "characteristics": "cell line: MCF10A; chip antibody: Rpb1 NTD - 14958S cell signaling"}, {"id": "GSM1208615", "title": "batch1_chrom1_LoVo_ESRRA_Rabbit_PassedQC", "description": "none", "characteristics": "cell line: LoVo; cell type: colon adenocarcinoma; enriched motif (p<0.001) with dbd sequence similarity > 65%.: Esrra_DBD_TAGCTC20NCG_AC_TTCAAGGTCAN_1_4_short; qc successful: PassedQC"}, {"id": "GSM1184306", "title": "HEART_2_RNA_POL2_SHAM", "description": "chip antibody: RNA Pol II (Rpb1 N-terminus); chip antibody manufacturer: Santa Cruz; chip antibody catalog number: SC-899; tissue: heart; treatment: sham; genetic background: C57Bl/6J", "characteristics": "Mus musculus"}, {"id": "GSM2406724", "title": "AHRR_DMSO_24h_ChIPSeq", "description": "Cells were treated with either DMSO (vehicle) or 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-\u03c1-dioxin (TCDD) for either 45min or 24h", "characteristics": "cell type: epithelial cells; tissue: mammary gland, breast; chip-antibody: anti-AHRR (Sigma, HPA019614)"}, {"id": "GSM2285641", "title": "Host_Patient11_Romi_Day0", "description": "For patients diagnosed with CTCL were treated with either Vorinostat of Romidepsin, based on their clinical tests.", "characteristics": "subject status: patiet with cutaneous T cell leukemia (CTCL); subject gender: Male; cell type: human CD4+ T cell; cell subtype: Host Cells"}, {"id": "GSM1442896", "title": "P300b-_RB1_ChIP-seq", "description": "1x10^8 low passage IMR90 lung fibroblasts were grown to confluence in 15 cm dishes.

Cross-linked nuclei were isolated, followed by sonication with a Covaris S2 shearing device (duty cycle 10%, intensity 5, 15 minutes), to obtain chromatin-containing DNA fragments with an average size of ~200-400bp. For each ChIP, 20 \u03bcg of antibody or the appropriate control IgG species was used. Samples were immunoprecipitated with antibodies against BPTF, H4R3me2a, SET1, USF1(H-86x, Santa Cruz) and USF2 (H-86x, Santa Cruz). The antigen-antibody complex was captured on protein G beads, washed four times with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer, and then washed with phosphate-buffered saline.

Cells were then infected with lentiviruses separately encoding either OSKM or OS(v)KM at multiplicities of infections (MOIs) that were determined to be optimal for reprogramming (see Suppl Table 2). Media was changed daily until the time of harvest on day 5. At the time of harvest, cells on plates were washed once with PBS (room temperature) and cross-linked by adding EMEM + 10% FBS containing 1% fomaldehyde. Plates were returned to the incubator and incubated for 10-15 minutes. Cells were washed twice with ice cold PBS containing a cocktail of protease inhibitors (Sigma Cat # P8340; 10ml/ml PBS) and 1mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). Cross-linked cells from each condition (Mock infected MRC5, OSKM or OS(v)KM; all at passage 8) were scraped using a cell scraper, pooled in 15 ml tubes and pelleted. We typically pooled cross-linked cells from at least 4-5, 10cm plates per condition (~ 5 million cells) for each ChIP-Seq assay.

In mammals NRF1 functions as a transcription factor that activates the expression of the EIF2S1 (EIF-alpha) gene. This protein links the transcriptional modulation of key metabolic genes to cellular growth and development, and has been implicated in the control of nuclear genes required for respiration, heme biosynthesis and mitochondrialDNA transcription and replication. NRF1 forms a homodimer and binds DNA as a dimer. NRF1 shows a nuclear localization and is expressed widely in embryonic, fetal and adult tissues.

Cells were then infected with lentiviruses separately encoding either OSKM or OS(v)KM at multiplicities of infections (MOIs) that were determined to be optimal for reprogramming (see Suppl Table 2). Media was changed daily until the time of harvest on day 5. At the time of harvest, cells on plates were washed once with PBS (room temperature) and cross-linked by adding EMEM + 10% FBS containing 1% fomaldehyde. Plates were returned to the incubator and incubated for 10-15 minutes. Cells were washed twice with ice cold PBS containing a cocktail of protease inhibitors (Sigma Cat # P8340; 10ml/ml PBS) and 1mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). Cross-linked cells from each condition (Mock infected MRC5, OSKM or OS(v)KM; all at passage 8) were scraped using a cell scraper, pooled in 15 ml tubes and pelleted.

For reChIPs, the first antibody (anti-RXRa) was covalently linked to the sepharose\u2013protein A (Sigma) using disuccinimidyl suberate. The covalently linked antibody beads were washed with ethanolamine (0.1 M), followed by gly\u00accine (pH 2.8). Beads prewashed with 50 mM sodium borate (pH 8.2) and were incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C as for regular ChIPs. After standard washing, elution was performed with 10 mM dithiotreitol (DTT) (30 min, 37 \u00b0C). Eluates from at least four ChIPs were combined, diluted at least 30 times with lysis buffer (containing protease inhibitors) and incubated overnight with the second antibody (anti-RAR\u03b3) and protein-A beads at 4 \u00b0C.

For the 72h RNA-seq, cells were treated for 24h with the specific treatment, and then the media was changed, and cells were collected 48h later (72h total). For ChIP-seq experiments, the YAP1 and TEAD4 ChIP-seq were performed in hESCs growing in TeSR media. In addition, the YAP1 ChIP-seq was also performed in the YAP-KO cells. The beta-catenin, Smad2,3 and CTD-Ser7P RNAPII ChIP-seq experiments were performed in the WT and the YAP-KO hESCs after Activin exposure for 15h. The PiggyYAP cell line was generated by stably transfecting the YAP-KO cells with the transposon-based vector Piggyback containing a Flag-YAP cDNA construct under the control of a doxycycline-inducible promoter. This system allowed us to control YAP levels in the same hESC line from zero (-Dox) to over-expression levels (aprox. Dox 50ng/ml).

the second allele has a G>A transition within intron 22 located 11 nucleotides 5-prime of the normal splice acceptor site [IVS22AS,G>A,-11] resulting in the generation of a novel splice acceptor site and a 9-bp insertion in the processed RNA. This results in the insertion of 3 amino acids (serine, threonine, and proline) at codon 744 (744ins3). The insertion was within the conserved region of the catalytic domain, which is likely to be disrupted by the insertion of a proline residue.
