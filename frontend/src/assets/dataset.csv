C., Weissman, S. M., and Gallagher, P. G. (2009) Mol Cell Biol). 1 × 107 cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, followed by Dounce homogenization. Cross-linked nuclei were isolated, followed by sonication with a Covaris S2 shearing device (duty cycle 10%, intensity 5, 15 minutes), to obtain chromatin-containing DNA fragments with an average size of ~200-400bp. For each ChIP, 20 μg of antibody or the appropriate control IgG species was used. Samples were immunoprecipitated with antibodies against BPTF, H4R3me2a, SET1, USF1(H-86x, Santa Cruz) and USF2 (H-86x, Santa Cruz). The antigen-antibody complex was captured on protein G beads, washed four times with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer, and then washed with phosphate-buffered saline. The DNA-protein complex was eluted from the protein G beads with 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate at 65°C, and cross-linking of DNA-protein adducts was reversed by overnight incubation at 65°C.   After proteinase K and RNase digestion of the reverse-cross-linked sample, DNA was extracted with phenol-chloroform, precipitated with ethanol, then cleaned with the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer instructions. - Characteristics: cell type: R3/R4 Erythroid cells; chip antibody: SET1; antibody info: Bethyl Laboratory  Cat#:  A300-289A = ",Cell Line: None - Cell Type: Erythroid Cell - Tissue Type: None - Factor: SETD1A $

The protein localizes to the nucleus where it may form a homodimer or a heterodimer with estrogen receptor 2. Estrogen and its receptors are essential for sexual development and reproductive function, but also play a role in other tissues such as bone. Estrogen receptors are also involved in pathological processes including breast cancer, endometrial cancer, and osteoporosis.

All samples for all assays were harvested at three days post-transfection.; The dCas9-VP64 expression plasmid was transfected at a mass ratio of 3:1 to either the individual gRNA expression plasmids or the identical amount of gRNA expression plasmid consisting of a mixture of equal; amounts of combinations of gRNAs. The expression plasmids for TALE-VP64 (Perez-Pinera et al.2013b) and dCas9-VP64 and gRNAs (Perez-Pinera et al. 2013a) have been previously described. TALE and gRNA target sequences are provided in Supplemental Table 1. TALEs targeted to the HBG1/2; promoter were designed using TALE-NT 2.0 (Doyle et al. 2012) and assembled using the GoldenGate kit (Cermak et al. 2011) acquired through Addgene as described previously (Perez-Pinera et al. 2013b). - Characteristics: cell line: HEK293T; transfection: dcas9_VP64 targetting IL1RN = ,Cell Line: HEK293T - Cell Type: Epithelium - Tissue Type: Embryonic Kidney - Factor: IL1RN $

Samples were then microdissected to remove the cortex (~0.5 mm) and incubated for an additional 30 minutes at room temperature in fresh 1% PFA crosslink buffer. Crosslinking was stopped by the addition of glycine. Tissue was washed with PBS containing protease inhibitors (PI) and resuspended in fresh PBS+PI. Tissue was spread across 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes and homogenized with a motorized pestle. Homogenized tissue was pelleted, resuspended in mouse ChIP lysis buffer (PMID:22902740), and recombined. The tissue was lysed with the aid of a B dounce homogenizer and incubated on ice for 20 minutes. Processing of the samples from this point was carried forward using the mouse ChIP protocol (PMID:22902740). Sequencing libraries were made using the ThruPLEX-FD Prep Kit (Rubicon Genomics).

Cross-linked nuclei were isolated, followed by sonication with a Covaris S2 shearing device (duty cycle 10%, intensity 5, 15 minutes), to obtain chromatin-containing DNA fragments with an average size of ~200-400bp. For each ChIP, 20 μg of antibody or the appropriate control IgG species was used. Samples were immunoprecipitated with antibodies against BPTF, H4R3me2a, SET1, USF1(H-86x, Santa Cruz) and USF2 (H-86x, Santa Cruz). The antigen-antibody complex was captured on protein G beads, washed four times with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer, and then washed with phosphate-buffered saline. The DNA-protein complex was eluted from the protein G beads with 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate at 65°C, and cross-linking of DNA-protein adducts was reversed by overnight incubation at 65°C.   After proteinase K and RNase digestion of the reverse-cross-linked sample, DNA was extracted with phenol-chloroform, precipitated with ethanol, then cleaned with the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer instructions. - Characteristics: cell type: R3/R4 Erythroid cells; chip antibody: BPTF; antibody info: Polyclonal rabbit antibody against chicken BPT fragment (aa2775-2789) = ",Cell Line: None - Cell Type: Erythroid Cell - Tissue Type: None - Factor: BPTF $

Twenty-four hours later, two plates were trypsinzed to get an estimate of average number of cells in each 10 cm plate. Cells were then infected with lentiviruses separately encoding either OSKM or OS(v)KM at multiplicities of infections (MOIs) that were determined to be optimal for reprogramming (see Suppl Table 2). Media was changed daily until the time of harvest on day 5. At the time of harvest, cells on plates were washed once with PBS (room temperature) and cross-linked by adding EMEM + 10% FBS containing 1% fomaldehyde. Plates were returned to the incubator and incubated for 10-15 minutes. Cells were washed twice with ice cold PBS containing a cocktail of protease inhibitors (Sigma Cat # P8340; 10ml/ml PBS) and 1mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). Cross-linked cells from each condition (Mock infected MRC5, OSKM or OS(v)KM; all at passage 8) were scraped using a cell scraper, pooled in 15 ml tubes and pelleted. We typically pooled cross-linked cells from at least 4-5, 10cm plates per condition (~ 5 million cells) for each ChIP-Seq assay.

Twenty-four hours later, two plates were trypsinzed to get an estimate of average number of cells in each 10 cm plate. Cells were then infected with lentiviruses separately encoding either OSKM or OS(v)KM at multiplicities of infections (MOIs) that were determined to be optimal for reprogramming (see Suppl Table 2). Media was changed daily until the time of harvest on day 5. At the time of harvest, cells on plates were washed once with PBS (room temperature) and cross-linked by adding EMEM + 10% FBS containing 1% fomaldehyde. Plates were returned to the incubator and incubated for 10-15 minutes. Cells were washed twice with ice cold PBS containing a cocktail of protease inhibitors (Sigma Cat # P8340; 10ml/ml PBS) and 1mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). Cross-linked cells from each condition (Mock infected MRC5, OSKM or OS(v)KM; all at passage 8) were scraped using a cell scraper, pooled in 15 ml tubes and pelleted. We typically pooled cross-linked cells from at least 4-5, 10cm plates per condition (~ 5 million cells) for each ChIP-Seq assay. As controls, we harvested approximately 5 million cross-linked human ES (H9 hESCs, p. 35) or human iPS cells (an iPSC line derived using OS(v)KM (3S2 hiPSC, p.20) from on 6 cm plates and grown in feeder-free conditions (on vitronectin-coated plates and grown in Essential 8 media). - Characteristics: chip antibody: Klf4 (R&D Systems AF3640); cell line: MRC5 fibroblasts; passage: 8 = ",Cell Line: MRC5 - Cell Type: Fibroblast - Tissue Type: Lung - Factor: KLF4 $

In mammals NRF1 functions as a transcription factor that activates the expression of the EIF2S1 (EIF-alpha) gene. This protein links the transcriptional modulation of key metabolic genes to cellular growth and development, and has been implicated in the control of nuclear genes required for respiration, heme biosynthesis and mitochondrialDNA transcription and replication. NRF1 forms a homodimer and binds DNA as a dimer. NRF1 shows a nuclear localization and is expressed widely in embryonic, fetal and adult tissues.

Twenty-four hours later, two plates were trypsinzed to get an estimate of average number of cells in each 10 cm plate. Cells were then infected with lentiviruses separately encoding either OSKM or OS(v)KM at multiplicities of infections (MOIs) that were determined to be optimal for reprogramming (see Suppl Table 2). Media was changed daily until the time of harvest on day 5. At the time of harvest, cells on plates were washed once with PBS (room temperature) and cross-linked by adding EMEM + 10% FBS containing 1% fomaldehyde. Plates were returned to the incubator and incubated for 10-15 minutes. Cells were washed twice with ice cold PBS containing a cocktail of protease inhibitors (Sigma Cat # P8340; 10ml/ml PBS) and 1mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). Cross-linked cells from each condition (Mock infected MRC5, OSKM or OS(v)KM; all at passage 8) were scraped using a cell scraper, pooled in 15 ml tubes and pelleted. We typically pooled cross-linked cells from at least 4-5, 10cm plates per condition (~ 5 million cells) for each ChIP-Seq assay. As controls, we harvested approximately 5 million cross-linked human ES (H9 hESCs, p. 35) or human iPS cells (an iPSC line derived using OS(v)KM (3S2 hiPSC, p.20) from on 6 cm plates and grown in feeder-free conditions (on vitronectin-coated plates and grown in Essential 8 media). - Characteristics: chip antibody: Oct4 (Abcam ab19857 Lot: GR187600-1); cell line: iPS cells; protocol: iPS 3s2; passage: 20 = ",Cell Line: iPS cells - Cell Type: iPSC - Tissue Type: None - Factor: POU5F1 $

Cross-linked nuclei were isolated, followed by sonication with a Covaris S2 shearing device (duty cycle 10%, intensity 5, 15 minutes), to obtain chromatin-containing DNA fragments with an average size of ~200-400bp. For each ChIP, 20 µg of antibody or the appropriate control IgG species was used. Samples were immunoprecipitated with antibodies against GATA1 (sc-265; Santa Cruz), NF-E2 (sc-22827; Santa Cruz), KLF1 (ab2483; Abcam), SCL/Tal1 (sc-12984; Santa Cruz), P300 (sc-585; Santa Cruz) and nonspecific rabbit IgG (sc-2091; Santa Cruz). The antigen-antibody complex was captured on protein G beads, washed four times with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer, and then washed with phosphate-buffered saline. The DNA-protein complex was eluted from the protein G beads with 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate at 65°C, and cross-linking of DNA-protein adducts was reversed by 4 hours of incubation at 65°C. After proteinase K and RNase digestion of the reverse-cross-linked sample, DNA was cleaned with the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer instructions. - Characteristics: cell: R3/R4 Erythroid cells; chip antibody: KLF1 = ",Cell Line: None - Cell Type: Erythroid Cell - Tissue Type: None - Factor: KLF1 $

GSM811211,"Title: ERa e2 10k LinDA rep2 - Description: Cells were fixed with 1% para¬formaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences) for 30 min at 25 °C. ChIPs were performed following standard conditions: chromatin sonication (200–500 bp length) and immunoprcipitation in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8), 140 mM NaCl, 1m M EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% Na-deoxycholate) complemented with pro¬tease inhibitor cocktail (Roche); two washes with lysis buffer; two washes with lysis buffer containing 360 mM NaCl; two washes with washing buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8), 250 mM LiCl, 0.5% NP-40, 1 mM EDTA and 0.5% Na-deoxycholate); two washes with TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8) and 1 mM EDTA); elution at 65 °C; 15 min in elution buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8), 10 mM EDTA, 1% SDS). The small-cell-number ChIPs were per¬formed following the original protocol described above except for the antibody amounts (anti-ERα, 2 μg for 2 million and 100,000 cells, 0.5 μg for 10,000 and 5,000 cells; anti-H3K4me3, 1 μg for 1 million cells, 0.25 μg for 10,000 cells). For reChIPs, the first antibody (anti-RXRa) was covalently linked to the sepharose–protein A (Sigma) using disuccinimidyl suberate. The covalently linked antibody beads were washed with ethanolamine (0.1 M), followed by gly¬cine (pH 2.8). Beads prewashed with 50 mM sodium borate (pH 8.2) and were incubated overnight at 4 °C as for regular ChIPs. After standard washing, elution was performed with 10 mM dithiotreitol (DTT) (30 min, 37 °C). Eluates from at least four ChIPs were combined, diluted at least 30 times with lysis buffer (containing protease inhibitors) and incubated overnight with the second antibody (anti-RARγ) and protein-A beads at 4 °C. The subsequent steps were performed as for regular ChIPs. reChIP-seq protocol is available in PROTOCOL EXCHANGE (2011) DOI 10.1038/protex.2011.256. LinDA amplification has been performed as described in Pattabhiraman et al. ((2011),  Nature Methods 8, 565-67).

The small-cell-number ChIPs were per¬formed following the original protocol described above except for the antibody amounts (anti-ERα, 2 μg for 2 million and 100,000 cells, 0.5 μg for 10,000 and 5,000 cells; anti-H3K4me3, 1 μg for 1 million cells, 0.25 μg for 10,000 cells). For reChIPs, the first antibody (anti-RXRa) was covalently linked to the sepharose–protein A (Sigma) using disuccinimidyl suberate. The covalently linked antibody beads were washed with ethanolamine (0.1 M), followed by gly¬cine (pH 2.8). Beads prewashed with 50 mM sodium borate (pH 8.2) and were incubated overnight at 4 °C as for regular ChIPs. After standard washing, elution was performed with 10 mM dithiotreitol (DTT) (30 min, 37 °C). Eluates from at least four ChIPs were combined, diluted at least 30 times with lysis buffer (containing protease inhibitors) and incubated overnight with the second antibody (anti-RARγ) and protein-A beads at 4 °C. The subsequent steps were performed as for regular ChIPs. reChIP-seq protocol is available in PROTOCOL EXCHANGE (2011) DOI 10.1038/protex.2011.256.

Twenty-four hours later, two plates were trypsinzed to get an estimate of average number of cells in each 10 cm plate. Cells were then infected with lentiviruses separately encoding either OSKM or OS(v)KM at multiplicities of infections (MOIs) that were determined to be optimal for reprogramming (see Suppl Table 2). Media was changed daily until the time of harvest on day 5. At the time of harvest, cells on plates were washed once with PBS (room temperature) and cross-linked by adding EMEM + 10% FBS containing 1% fomaldehyde. Plates were returned to the incubator and incubated for 10-15 minutes. Cells were washed twice with ice cold PBS containing a cocktail of protease inhibitors (Sigma Cat # P8340; 10ml/ml PBS) and 1mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). Cross-linked cells from each condition (Mock infected MRC5, OSKM or OS(v)KM; all at passage 8) were scraped using a cell scraper, pooled in 15 ml tubes and pelleted. We typically pooled cross-linked cells from at least 4-5, 10cm plates per condition (~ 5 million cells) for each ChIP-Seq assay. As controls, we harvested approximately 5 million cross-linked human ES (H9 hESCs, p. 35) or human iPS cells (an iPSC line derived using OS(v)KM (3S2 hiPSC, p.20) from on 6 cm plates and grown in feeder-free conditions (on vitronectin-coated plates and grown in Essential 8 media). - Characteristics: chip antibody: Sox2 (R&D Systems AF2018); cell line: MRC5 fibroblasts; passage: 8 = ",Cell Line: MRC5 - Cell Type: Fibroblast - Tissue Type: Lung - Factor: SOX2 $

For RNA-seq the different cell lines were left untreated or treated with the cytokines or molecules indicated (Activin, XV or ChIR) for 24h or 30h in TeSR media. For the 72h RNA-seq, cells were treated for 24h with the specific treatment, and then the media was changed, and cells were collected 48h later (72h total). For ChIP-seq experiments, the YAP1 and TEAD4 ChIP-seq were performed in hESCs growing in TeSR media. In addition, the YAP1 ChIP-seq was also performed in the YAP-KO cells. The beta-catenin, Smad2,3 and CTD-Ser7P RNAPII ChIP-seq experiments were performed in the WT and the YAP-KO hESCs after Activin exposure for 15h. The PiggyYAP cell line was generated by stably transfecting the YAP-KO cells with the transposon-based vector Piggyback containing a Flag-YAP cDNA construct under the control of a doxycycline-inducible promoter. This system allowed us to control YAP levels in the same hESC line from zero (-Dox) to over-expression levels (aprox. Dox 50ng/ml). The ChIP-seq of CTD-Ser7P RNAPII was performed in the PiggyYAP cells treated with Activin for 15h in absence (no dox) or in presence of doxycycline (+dox). - Characteristics: genotype: WT; treatment: Activin A; treatment_time: 15h; antibody: Smad2_3 = ",Cell Line: H1 - Cell Type: Embryonic Stem Cell - Tissue Type: Embryo - Factor: SMAD2 $

Twenty-four hours later, two plates were trypsinzed to get an estimate of average number of cells in each 10 cm plate. Cells were then infected with lentiviruses separately encoding either OSKM or OS(v)KM at multiplicities of infections (MOIs) that were determined to be optimal for reprogramming (see Suppl Table 2). Media was changed daily until the time of harvest on day 5. At the time of harvest, cells on plates were washed once with PBS (room temperature) and cross-linked by adding EMEM + 10% FBS containing 1% fomaldehyde. Plates were returned to the incubator and incubated for 10-15 minutes. Cells were washed twice with ice cold PBS containing a cocktail of protease inhibitors (Sigma Cat # P8340; 10ml/ml PBS) and 1mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). Cross-linked cells from each condition (Mock infected MRC5, OSKM or OS(v)KM; all at passage 8) were scraped using a cell scraper, pooled in 15 ml tubes and pelleted. We typically pooled cross-linked cells from at least 4-5, 10cm plates per condition (~ 5 million cells) for each ChIP-Seq assay. As controls, we harvested approximately 5 million cross-linked human ES (H9 hESCs, p. 35) or human iPS cells (an iPSC line derived using OS(v)KM (3S2 hiPSC, p.20) from on 6 cm plates and grown in feeder-free conditions (on vitronectin-coated plates and grown in Essential 8 media). - Characteristics: chip antibody: Klf4 (R&D Systems AF3640); cell line: MRC5 fibroblasts; protocol: Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and Myc addition; time: 5 days; passage: 8 = ",Cell Line: MRC5 - Cell Type: Fibroblast - Tissue Type: Lung - Factor: KLF4 $

Crosslinking was performed with the addition of 1/10th volume of crosslinking solution (11%  formaldehyde, 100mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA pH 8, 0.5mM EGTA pH 8, 50mM Hepes pH 7.8) for a  final formaldehyde concentration of 1% for 10 minutes at room temperature. The reaction was  quenched with the addition of 250mM glycine and incubation at room temperature for 5 minutes.  Cells were washed twice with cold DPBS and counted using a Vi-CELL cell counter (Beckman  Coulter, France). Cells were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen in aliquots of 5x107cells/pellet.  T-cells were sorted using the AutoMACS (Miltenyi, France) system. After labelling with anti-CD8  antibodies coupled to PE (Miltenyi, France), cells were incubated with anti-PE multisort  magnetic beads (Miltenyi, France) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Sorting was  performed using a single positive selection. Cells were released and incubated with anti-CD4  magnetic beads (Miltenyi, France) according to manufacturer’s instructions. After a subsequent  single positive selection, sorting efficiency was verified through flow cytometry analysis. Sorted  CD4+/CD8+ thymocytes were counted and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen in aliquots of 5x107  cells/pellet for further processing. - Characteristics: tissue: Burkitt's lymphoma; passages: N.D.; cell line: Raji; antibody: PolII; vendor/catalog#: Santa Cruz/sc-899x = ",Cell Line: Raji - Cell Type: B Lymphocyte - Tissue Type: Blood - Factor: POLR2A $

For every 4-5 ml of cell pellet volume 100 ml of NEB buffer+0.1 mM PMSF pre-chilled on ice were added. Without delay, 100 ml of cell/nuclear homogenate was poured into a T-225 flask containing a room-temperature mixture of 360 ml of PBS and 40 ml of 37% formaldehyde and incubated for 30 min at 25°C on a orbital shaker platform with vigorous shaking (100rpm). Fixed nuclei were pelleted by spinning for 10 min at 4000 g, +4°C. The supernatant was carefully decanted and the nuclear pellet was washed four times with 100 ml of ice-cold PBS with 0.1 mM PMSF. Nuclei were pelleted between washes for 10 min at 4000g, +4°C. Nuclei were resuspended in glycerol buffer and snap-frozen in liquid N2 prior to further processing. Frozen nuclear extracts from human 293 T-Rex cells were thawed and spun down for 10 min at 4000 g, +4°C. Pellets were washed with 10-20 volumes of TE buffer with 0.1 mM PMSF and spun down for 10 min at 4000g, +4°C. Pellets were again re-suspended with 10 volumes of TE buffer with 0.1 mM PMSF by pipetting up and down. SDS was added to the mixture to a final concentration of 1%. The mixture was inverted in the tube 10 times and spun down for10 min at 4000 g, +4°C. The supernatant was carefully removed (Note: the pellet may be quite loose) and the pellet was re-suspended with 10 volumes of TE buffer with 0.1 mM PMSF by pipetting and further spun down for 10 min at 4000 g, +4°C. This washing step was repeated twice. The pellet was re-suspended with 1.5 volumes of TE buffer with 0.1 mM PMSF by pipetting up and down. SDS was added to a mixture to a final concentration of 0.1%. The resulting viscous mixture was sonicated in 4.5 ml aliquots using a Misonix Sonicator 3000 with Microtip power output level 7 and total sonication processing time of 5 min (human sample), 15 sec pulse “on” and 45 sec “off” time to generate DNA fragments in the range of 300-2000 bp.   Triton X-100 (1% final) and NaCl (140 mM final) were added to the sonicated samples. Samples were mixed on a rotating wheel for 5 min  at +4C and spun down for 10 min at 10000 g, +4°C. The supernatant containing the soluble chromatin was collected. Note: In order to control for chromatin input composition and quality (for protein, DNA and RNA), a 1 ml aliquot is reserved before proceeding with the next step. - Characteristics: pull-down biotap: C17orf96 C-terminal BioTAP = ",Cell Line: HEK293T - Cell Type: Epithelium - Tissue Type: Embryonic Kidney - Factor: C17orf96 $

Nuclei were isolated and chromatin was purified by chemical lysis. Next, the purified chromatin was fragmented to 200-300 bp fragments by sonication (Covaris, S220, Focused-ultrasonicator). Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed by incubation of the chromatin fraction overnight with 100 ul of protein-A coated beads (Thermo-Scientific, catalog number 53139) and 10 μg of fibrillarin-specific (Abcam, ab5821) or TLX1-specific antibody (Santa-Cruz Biotechnology, sc-880).

This results in the insertion of 3 amino acids (serine, threonine, and proline) at codon 744 (744ins3).
